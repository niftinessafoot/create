# Create-Project

An npm initializer for generating Niftiness Afoot projects, modules, and sites.

## who’s this for?

Really, [me](https://github.com/niftinessafoot). Feel free to use it if you wanna, too. But take heed:

1. This is super-duper-über beta. And probably always will be.
2. I tweak and tinker like Han Solo on the _Millennium Falcon_. Don’t count on any libnrary or config being here from day-to-day. Sure, I’ll SemVer all this, but seriously—go use Create React App or something.

## noted. how do I use it?

Okay. If you insist.

```bash
npm init @afoot/project <flags>
```

with the following flags:

- `-n, --name <name>`
- `-e, --entry <entry>`
- `-t, --type <'module'|'site'>`
